## Background 
Sequencing Platform  
- **Illumina HiSeq 2500**  
- **Paired-end**  
- **250 bp sequencing reads**  
 
These files include:  
- **20 total samples**  
- **2 different pond sampling locations**  
- **2 "treatments"**  
  - Microbiome sampled directly from duckweed skimmed off the surface of the pond  
  - Microbiome sampled directly from pond water  
- **5 replicates of each treatment**  
- **Metadata file:** Provides information for Qiime about sample identities  
- **Manifest file:** Specifies the location of FASTQ files for Qiime import
